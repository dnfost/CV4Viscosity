# CV4Viscosity
Introduction.<br/>
The aim of this project is to develop a more accurate method of calculating the viscosity of oil being used in the determination of the skin friction coefficient over complex geometry. This program uses computer vision, instead of human vision, to monitor the descent of a ball through a tube of oil. The time taken for the ball's descent, once it has reached its terminal velocity, is an indicator of the viscosity of the oil. In this program, a video file is specified by the user for analysis. Computer vision is used to identify a ball falling in oil, and track its trajectory on a spreadsheet, which is read to generate plots of the ball's motion. These plots can be examined by a human, who can provide a time interval for analysis, and the program will compute the mean and best-fit velocities, and their associated uncertainties.<br/>
